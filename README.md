# Med-Mitra: Multimodal Clinical Insight Assistant

**Med-Mitra** is an AI-powered clinical assistant designed for healthcare professionals to rapidly analyze patient cases by combining:
- Case summaries (typed or dictated)
- Lab reports (CSV/PDF)
- Radiology images (JPG/PNG)

It uses multimodal reasoning to return structured clinical insights in the SOAP format, along with differential diagnoses, treatment suggestions, per-file interpretations, and a confidence score.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- **Multimodal Fusion**: Combines text, lab results, and radiology for holistic AI interpretation
- **Voice Support**: Real-time voice-to-text using Deepgram
- **Image Captioning**: AI captions radiology images with BLIP
- **Structured Output**: SOAP note, diagnoses, treatment, and interpretation
- **PDF Export**: Generate downloadable case summaries
- **Fast Interface**: Lightweight and responsive Streamlit frontend

---

## 🔄 App Flow

### 1. Web UI (Streamlit)
Doctors can:
- Enter case summaries (voice or text)
- Upload lab reports and radiology images
- Retrieve old cases using Case ID or Patient ID

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)
- Receives uploads, parses data
- Stores metadata in a local database (POSTGRESQL)
- Calls the AI engine and returns structured insights

### 3. AI Engine (LLMs + Captioning)
- Lab Parser: Extracts structured fields from CSV/PDF
- Image Captioner: Describes chest X-rays using BLIP
- LLM (via Groq): Synthesizes SOAP + diagnoses + treatment plan

## 📉 Limitations & Challenges

| Area               | Challenge                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Image Captioning** | BLIP isn't fine-tuned for medical imaging (e.g., chest X-rays, MRIs)   |
| **PDF Parsing**    | Lab PDF formats vary; extraction accuracy may differ across files         |
| **Speech Input**   | Depends on mic/hardware/browser; may timeout or misinterpret long input   |
| **LLM Output**     | Occasional hallucinations or incomplete SOAP format generation            |
| **API Usage Limits** | Free-tier limits from Groq/Deepgram may restrict daily app usage       |
